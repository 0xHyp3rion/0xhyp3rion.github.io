      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-primer-for-beginners-and-encouragement-for-junior-to-mid-level-soc&#34;&gt;A Primer for Beginners and Encouragement for Junior to Mid-Level SOC&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world of Cybersecurity is, in a nutshell, complex. There is no one size fits all solution to prevent against threats, and there is no one size fits all book, instructional video, or article that will help anyone wanting to succeed in the field. The technology field is dynamic, constantly changing, and within every broad category of tech exists broad specializations that each have their own specializations within the specialization. As technology grows, changes, and adapts, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to keep up to date with these changes and to understand the overall broad concepts where all of these puzzle pieces fit into. Cybersecurity is a specific specialization within the field of Information Technology that focuses on securing (and/or breaking) pieces of technology to make those systems more secure. Where do we start? How do we navigate the industry? And most importantly, how do we keep from falling behind?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
