<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The world of Cybersecurity is, in a nutshell, complex. There is no one size fits all solution to prevent against threats, and there is no one size fits all book, instructional video, or article that will help anyone wanting to succeed in the field. The technology field is dynamic, constantly changing, and within every broad category of tech exists broad specializations that each have their own specializations within the specialization. As technology grows, changes, and adapts, it&rsquo;s important to be able to keep up to date with these changes and to understand the overall broad concepts where all of these puzzle pieces fit into. Cybersecurity is a specific specialization within the field of Information Technology that focuses on securing (and/or breaking) pieces of technology to make those systems more secure. Where do we start? How do we navigate the industry? And most importantly, how do we keep from falling behind?</p>
<h3 id="the-skills-you-need">The Skills You Need</h3>
<p>Over the summer of 2023 I spent some time exploring Discord servers tailored to ethical hacking. I learned some new ideas, and met some great people by exploring these social platforms, but a funny trend persisted in all of them: Teenagers coming in and asking for someone to teach them how to hack. All of the community who were present would be willing to help, and would start screening the person asking them what they know and what they&rsquo;re looking to do. Almost all of them just wanted to know how to hack, typically for revenge, and were quickly whisked out of the platform. The ones that were genuinely interested were surprised to learn that the entry point to learning how to hack wasn&rsquo;t with hacking itself, but was understanding how computers work, how networking works, and then progressing into security. It&rsquo;s important to note here that the overwhelming concensus about Cybersecurity from any writeup or video I&rsquo;ve read and watched points out that this is not an entry level profession, and whether you&rsquo;ve had years working IT Helpdesk, as a Programmer, as a Network Engineer, or any other field within Information Technology, wrapping your head around Cybersecurity from a skills perspective means having to learn skills and concepts that you may not have thought were necessary. Here is a list of 10 skills that I, personally, believe are crucial and foundational on the journey to approaching the field of Cybersecurity, in order of foundations to build off of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>How computers work</li>
<li>Computer networking</li>
<li>System and network administration</li>
<li>Scripting</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Security theory</li>
<li>Defensive security (Blue Team)</li>
<li>Offensive security (Red Team)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the good news: The broad picture can feasibly be learned in under a year. Here&rsquo;s the bad news: You&rsquo;ll have to find the time to study, learn, and practice, most likely on your own time unless you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to work somewhere that allows you to study while at work; and if you are fortunate enough to have that, you need to be taking advantage of every single second the company allows you to be studying on the clock. In the following sections I&rsquo;ll go through each skill, one by one, and detail what they are and why they&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p><em>A Note on College:</em> A college degree is highly beneficial, but that does NOT mean a college degree is required - it&rsquo;s only a possible avenue that you could consider for obtaining or learning that skillset. College helps to some degree (pun intended), but is not a definitive method, and relies more on how you spent your time in college and learning. College helps you learn how to think while learning useful skills in the process; but the mere posession of a degree is meaningless unless you know how to put what you learned to use.</p>
<p><em>A Note on Certifications:</em> Certifications are not a cure-all, end-all solution. It&rsquo;s the journey that you take while you&rsquo;re studying for the certification, and the effort to which you challenge yourself that you retain and apply the information. I&rsquo;ve met people who are very good at studying for tests and passing them, but have no idea how to apply the information on a professional level because they never took the time to practice. I&rsquo;ve likewise met people who are terrible at studying for tests and passing them, but are very good at applying information on a professional level. My biggest piece of advice here is that if you want to get a certification, choose a project to work on while studying for the certification so that you both have a way to apply the skills you&rsquo;re learning while studying, and by the end of it have a portfolio project to show a manager or prospective employer.</p>
<h2 id="1-critical-thinking">1. Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>Critical thinking is the most important skill that you absolutely must have a grip on if you want to approach Cybersecurity, and is also one of the most difficult skills to illustrate how to develop and continually keep fresh as you progress through your journey. The reason why this is most difficult to convey is because it requires an individual to look within and challenge themselves with different points of view, opinions, even facts, that might challenge the way they perceive the world and themselves. It&rsquo;s a skill that allows you to be crtical of your observations and yourself without being judgemental, and to be able to map out probabilities in your head as you observe information, trying to predict how that information got there, and what that information might lead to. It&rsquo;s not something that can effectively be taught, but has to be practiced, refined, and revised continually. And, yes, some people are better at it than others, because we all have unique backgrounds, experiences, and environments that have shaped the way we navigate through and perceive ourselves and the world around us; but we are all capable of becoming critical thinkers. The most fun, and most difficult part, is finding out how to get there in a way that works for you.</p>
<p>So how do we develop critical thinking skills? There&rsquo;s a plethora of resources available on the internet, just Google &ldquo;How to think critically&rdquo; and get cracking. In terms of practical exercises, the best thing you can do is challenge yourself with something new, and maintain the patience in seeing it through. Learn something you know nothing about. Work on puzzles. Play games that make you think through the gameplay (like a strategy game). Take notes along the way. Journal your thoughts. Ask yourself, and others, &ldquo;why?.&rdquo; Take something apart and put it back together. Will you stumble? Probably, but the discomfort of failure is where we have the choice of giving up or learning from the failure and trying again from a different approach. If you give up, you won&rsquo;t learn, and learning is a continual process.</p>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing information requires the ability to ask questions about what the information is and how the information got there.</li>
<li>Mapping out possibilities, whether in your head or on your screen, can help lead to more solid and reasonable conclusions.</li>
<li>Having a chain of logic for others to follow to your conclusions makes you a more effective team member and leader.</li>
<li>Being able to respond to security events, hack, or troubleshoot issues, requires the ability to think through multiple avenues of approach.</li>
<li>Staying up to date with industry trends requires researching information.</li>
<li>Keeping skills up to date requires continuous learning and studying.</li>
<li>If you want to learn how to etchically hack, you need to know how to find weaknesses, which are usually hidden and have to be thought through.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-communication">2. Communication</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should list communication as the #1 skill or the #2 because it&rsquo;s almost equally as important as critical thinking, but regardless, you need to know how to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life who may know more or less than you do on a given topic. You need to be able to sell yourself to employers to land the job, to communicate with management and coworkers to achieve goals, write reports, and translate all of that in ways that non-technical people can also understand. Just like with critical thinking, communication isn&rsquo;t something that can be taught, but has to be learned over time, and a Google search for &ldquo;how to develop good communication skills&rdquo; can yield some fruitful results.</p>
<p>Exercises you can pursue are taking the time to write and having it read by a peer, friend, partner, etc., and using their feedback as a way to improve your writing. Focus on using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Recite speeches or theatrical monologues in a mirror. Explain highly technical concepts to your friends and family in ways they can understand, using analogies to help. Avoid using AI such as ChatGPT because, as with everything else, the learning and retention comes from the challenge of discomfort and the overcoming of failure, not from having something else do the work for us.</p>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to explain what the information you&rsquo;re looking at is or may be, as well as how it got there and where it might be going.</li>
<li>Writing reports.</li>
<li>Mentoring junior analysts, as well as being able to understand senior analysts when they are mentoring you.</li>
<li>Sharing information with stakeholders and key individuals in a way that complex technical concepts can be easily understood by all present.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-how-computers-work">3. How Computers Work</h2>
<p>Knowing how computers work is the bare-bones basic technical foundation that you need to progress any further in Cybersecurity. While you don&rsquo;t need to have a doctorate in computer science and be designing your own chips, you should at least understand how data is stored, retrieved, and transmitted in a conceptual way, along with understanding how to navigate through various operating systems, manipulate files, perform administrative tasks, and so on. The more technical you understand a computer, the better, because every single facet of a computer can be vulnerable to an attack with the right tools, experience, and mindset; and all devices that operate with a chip of some sort are a computer and function the exact same as the device you&rsquo;re reading this from right now. You&rsquo;ll need to use a computer to perform your work, and since computers are the vessels that store the precious data, and are used to attack that data, knowing how a computer works enables you to knowing how to secure that computer, and subsequentially the data stored on it, from an attack.</p>
<p>This is a field of study in and of itself, and is so deep and broad that there&rsquo;s no feasible way to master all of it; but it&rsquo;s crucial to be able to understand how to navigate the major operating systems out there (chiefly Windows, Linux, and MacOS), how to administer the operating systems, how to manipulate files, install/uninstall programs, and on a general/conceptual level, wrap your head around the basics about how the data traverses the various components of the computer, as well as what those components are and what makes them important.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Build your own PC</li>
<li>Upgrade a hardware module</li>
<li>Install Linux</li>
<li>Set up and install Windows and/or Linux on a Virtual Machine</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing how a computer works strengthens your ability to harden a computer from an attack.</li>
<li>If working as an analyst, you will need to know how to separate normal computer operation from abnormal operation.</li>
<li>Understanding how to navigate various operating systems and their unique syntaxes helps you understand activity.</li>
<li>Knowing how computers operate on a more scientific level enables understanding of how attacks can be performed in ways that may not be detected by conventional software, such as an antivirus solution.</li>
<li>Much analytical work involves understanding the overall functionality of an operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-computer-networking">4. Computer Networking</h2>
<p>Just like with knowing how a computer works, the next step is understanding how computers talk to one-another. Networking can get heady and complex, and unfortunately our current networking functionality wasn&rsquo;t originally designed with security in mind. Knowing networking is crucial because most attacks happen from a remote attacker trying to break in to another device over the internet, and being able to make sense of the traffic and how devices on a network can be interconnected helps make you a more rounded professional.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Set up an Ansible playbook.</li>
<li>Demo FHRP.</li>
<li>Configure a DHCP server.</li>
<li>Capture network traffic with Wireshark.</li>
<li>Deploy a WLC.</li>
<li>Set up VLANs on your home network</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing how devices communicate on a network is crucial for understanding most modern cyber attacks and how to defend against them.</li>
<li>Firewalls are some of the most important components in defending a network from attacks, and rely heavily on networking knowledge to configure and maintain.</li>
<li>Software and operating systems heavily utilize networking to perform critical functionality.</li>
<li>Most analytical work involves following and interpreting network traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-system-and-network-administration">5. System and Network Administration</h2>
<p>Even though I touched on this in the past two skills, I think it&rsquo;s important to outline as a skill in itself as it&rsquo;s easy to just use a computer but it&rsquo;s another challenge to be able to manage a computer, whether remotely or interactively, and most system and network administration involves understanding how computers and networks work. I&rsquo;ve already highlighted the reasons why in the previous two, but want to rehash that knowing how to set up, configure, and maintain devices and networking infrastructure is a crucial element on your way to the Cybersecurity path because most of it involves proactively preventing problems from occurring, whether that is in setting up Active Directory accounts with appropriate permissions for users, or configuring a firewall to disallow unwanted internet traffic.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Configure a gateway.</li>
<li>Set up a domain controller.</li>
<li>Set up an Active Directory environment.</li>
<li>Configure both Windows and Linux endpoints to connect to the domain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-scripting">6. Scripting</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about computers, networks, and how to keep them running, and if you&rsquo;re pursuing projects along the way, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed there&rsquo;s a lot of functions being performed that are redundant. Scripting is an excellent way to automate the processes that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve, whether it&rsquo;s keeping patches up to date on a remote system, checking to see if devices are online, collecting information about what programs are installed or how the device is performing, and beyond. Learning scripting, whether it&rsquo;s Powershell/Batch/VisualBasic (Windows) or Bash (Linux/Unix) is another critical step to being able to make sense of a lot of attacks, as well as a great first step to learning the next skill in this list, programming.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Too many to list.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers use scripts to automate attacks, and you will more than likely encounter an artifact in the form of a script. Knowing how to script enables you to be able to translate scripts other people write and determine what possible outcomes can occur from the script being run.</li>
<li>Processes and functions may need to be automated with your job. Being able to automate through scripting will save you immense time in a field where time is critical.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-programming">7. Programming</h2>
<p>Having a basic understanding of scripting makes programming even easier, since it ties together in a lot of ways. Pick a language and learn it. Popular programming languages in Cybersecurity include Python and C++, but ultimately any of them will suit you just fine. Malware can be written in anything, including Java, Ruby, C#, Rust, Go, and more.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Take a scripting project you created and convert it to your programming language of choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing a programming language helps you understand how to read other peoples&rsquo; code.</li>
<li>Malware analysis becomes a lot easier by knowing how programs can be written.</li>
<li>You can create additional tools and programs to help with your research, automation, and cyber defense/offense skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-security-theory">8. Security Theory</h2>
<p>This is an element where we get a little bit off of the technical side of things. Understanding security theory is a dull, but important, step in becoming an effective Cybersecurity professional, and a lot of the concepts that are attached to the world of Cybersecurity are also security concepts that are taken from and applied in the real world. Think of something as simple as locking a door. How can you use that same concept in regards to protecting a network from a particular attack? The overall concept here is hardening, which is an element of security theory. Through this you&rsquo;ll also learn many important terms and concepts that you will be required to know in any Cybersecurity job, such as the CIA triad, AAAs of Security, what a SIEM does, or what the difference is between an IDS and IPS, and etc.</p>
<p><em>Projects to Consider:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Set up and configure a SIEM.</li>
<li>Set up and configure an IDS/IPS.</li>
<li>Write a report about a novel threat or threat actor.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this is important for Cybersecurity:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning security theory is where you will then be able to apply secure concepts to the technical aspects you&rsquo;ve learned.</li>
<li>Security theory encompasses concepts, verbiage, and terminology that are crucial to know, define, and apply in the real world and at a job.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-defensive-security-blue-team">9. Defensive Security (Blue Team)</h2>
<h2 id="10-offensive-security-red-team">10. Offensive Security (Red Team)</h2>
<p>Knowing how to apply security theory to computer functions, networking, scripting, and programming now makes you qualified for a job as a SOC analyst (don&rsquo;t believe me? Look for SOC Analyst jobs, and I guarantee you that the prerequesites for most of the positions currently open detail at least one skill in each of these categories). This is the first step for most in the Cybersecurity industry, and sometimes the full career for many others. By learning how to defend against attacks, if you decide to pursue offensive security (Red Team Ops), you&rsquo;ll become a more proficient penetration tester/ethical hacker by knowing how the defenses can look, and choose your approaches more carefully, which leads us to Red Team. Knowing how to defend from attacks, you can now understand how to better avoid those defences on the red team side. Additionally, #9 and #10 here are somewhat interchangeable and continual, because knowing how attacks are executed makes an analyst a more effective defender, and knowing how to defend against attacks makes for more effective attack techniques.</p>
<p>Someone who wants to focus solely on cyber defense needs to get their feet wet in the offensive side, and visa versa, because these two skills are almost interchangeable and require one-another to continually learn and grow; but the foundations in all of the preceding skills are vital in continuing that growth and knowledge.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a more in-depth understanding of how the preceding skills play in to a Cybersecurity professional&rsquo;s overall career:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Necessary to follow the attack lifecycle, understand the attacker mindset, and predicting where the next target might be or discovering where initial access occurred or could occur. Discovering and addressing security holes and vulnerabilities. Understanding motives of attackers, attribution to a specific attacker or APT, following current events both in the tech industry and in geopolitics, economics, social trends, and more to determine possible targets, threats, and techniques. Understanding human psychology and the art of war.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Taking notes, compiling reports, and presenting these findings to relevant key personnel to be addressed. Translating these concepts to a basic level for broader understanding. Communicating security needs and why they are important. Collaboration with coworkers and vendors.</li>
<li><strong>How computers work:</strong> Finding ways where attackers can masquerade within and traverse around an operating system. Locating artifacts and Indicators of Compromise that may be hidden. Navigating through and traversing directories, user accounts, and authentication mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Networking:</strong> Finding ways where attackers can masquerade their movement across multiple devices by masquerading their traffic in a network. Following patterns of activity and recognizing unusual or malicious network traffic, like a needle in a haystack. Recognizing network attacks as they occur.</li>
<li><strong>System Administration:</strong> Finding ways where attackers can masquerade within and traverse around an operating system. Locating artifacts and Indicators of Compromise that may be hidden. Navigating through and traversing directories, user accounts, and authentication mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Automating processes. Reading and translating artifacts (i.e. malicious scripts).</li>
<li><strong>Programming:</strong> Developing programs or tools to assist with defense and automation. Malware analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Security Theory:</strong> Understanding the overall broader concepts so that when new technologies and vulnerabilities emerge they can be understood faster by applying the relevant concepts and theories to their application and use.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bonus-specialization">Bonus: Specialization</h2>
<p>If you really want to stand out from the crowd, specialize in a particular domain or technology that requires an emphasis on security. Technologies such as Active Directory, Cisco networking products, or even a protocol such as SMB where you can become the subject matter expert (SME) for your organization. Knowing the concept or technology in and out, including how it works, how it can be attacked, and how it can be defended, makes you stand out in any interview from the broad range of candidates who know that specific something exists and what it does, but don&rsquo;t know much else.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a one size fits all guide, but more an aggregate of information I&rsquo;ve gleaned from reading multiple writeups on navigating this field of expertise. It&rsquo;s worth repeating that Cybersecurity is not entry level, and if you haven&rsquo;t gleaned it by now, it&rsquo;s also not as glamorous or exciting as the media (and some certification and college programs) have advertised it as. It&rsquo;s a lot of tedium, a lot of logs, and a lot of learning, every single day. It requires a level of passion that is not easily found, and there are many people who pursue this career because of the belief in the glamor they&rsquo;ve been advertised but then quickly find out it&rsquo;s not what it appeared to be. It&rsquo;s overwhelming, and within the specialization of Cybersecurity are countless other specializations in various aspects. Again, it is not entry level, though you may luck out and find an employer who is willing to hire you on at an entry level role; but the learning will be up to you, and have to occur on time that you make for it. Nobody will hand you the answers, as in this field, there are rarely actual answers; just hypotheses that are backed by evidence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wish to discourage anyone from embarking on this career path. On the contrary, we need more skilled professionals to bridge the gap that exists, but I think it&rsquo;s important to highlight what is needed to exceed, and what is needed to grow, in order to ensure we don&rsquo;t get burned out from discovering that the reality is not the fantasy that we are led to believe.</p>
<p>Best of luck in your endeavors, and never, ever, stop learning.</p>
